Bayesian Network Based Inference Engine that works on Conditional Probability Distributions cannot have user data in its raw form. The Values of CPDs are in form of Example : Low,High / Yes,No depending upon the node requirements. 
This particular model is for data wrangling for a Bayesian Network Based Welfare Benefit Recommendation System, that filters the raw value of user data for different fields, maps it with required value from corresponding field's value mapping table and returns the updated user data that can now be given to the bayesian network for recommendation results.
